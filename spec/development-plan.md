# T3 Chat Clone - Development Plan

## 📋 Project Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step development plan for building a T3 Chat clone with a focus on:

- **Independent Development**: Backend and frontend developed separately with clear interfaces
- **Learning-Focused**: Each phase includes technology education and best practices
- **Security-First**: Secure coding practices and development processes throughout
- **Production-Ready**: Scalable architecture that can handle real-world usage

---

## 🎯 Development Philosophy

### Independent Development Approach

We'll develop the backend (NestJS API) and frontend (Next.js web app) independently, ensuring:

- Clear API contracts and interfaces
- Independent testing and deployment
- Loose coupling between services
- Ability to develop in parallel

### Learning-Focused Development

Each phase includes:

- **Technology Deep-Dive**: Understanding the "why" behind each choice
- **Best Practices**: Industry-standard patterns and conventions
- **Security Considerations**: Why security matters and how to implement it
- **Hands-On Practice**: Building incrementally with real examples

### Security-First Mindset

- **Secure by Design**: Security considerations from day one
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Following industry security standards
- **Regular Security Reviews**: Code reviews focused on security
- **Dependency Management**: Keeping dependencies updated and secure

2. **API Request** → Frontend sends authenticated request to backend
3. **Backend Processing** → NestJS handles business logic and database operations
4. **Real-time Updates** → WebSocket connections for live chat updates
5. **File Processing** → Background workers handle file uploads and processing
